# One Piece Character Selector
5.12.22
-----------------------------------------
Hello nakama and thank you for viewing my mini application!

I wanted to create a Street Fighter theme with a few of my favorite characters from the anime, One Piece! You, the user, can interact with my application by selecting your player (Zoro, Luffy, Ace, and Shanks) to a duel against Doflamingo. You can also select your battle location. Technologies I used was HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
